# Python Data Types

Data types are the classification or categorization of data storage and operations performed on it.

Following are the standard or built-in data type of Python:
* **Text Type**:	[Strings](https://github.com/thinessGit/learnPy/blob/main/Introduction/Strings.py)
* [**Numeric Types**](https://github.com/thinessGit/learnPy/blob/main/Introduction/Numeric.py):	int, float, complex  
* **Sequence Types**:	list, tuple, range
* **Mapping Type**:	dict
* **Set Types**:	set, frozenset
* **Boolean Type**:	bool
* **Binary Types**:	bytes, bytearray, memoryview

### [Python Strings](https://github.com/thinessGit/learnPy/blob/main/Introduction/Strings.py)
* Single Quotes ( ' )
  * Single Quotes is to represent strings by enclosing a series of characters
  * Single quotes is used when Double Quotes used in the series of characters
  * **Ex:** **'** They said, "Thank you!" **'**
* Double Quotes ( " )
  * Double Quotes is to represent strings by enclosing a series of characters
  * Double quotes is used when Single Quotes used in the series of characters
  * **Ex:**  **"** I'm learning Python coding **"**    
* Triple Quotes ( ''' ) or ( """ )
  * Triple Quotes is to represent series of characters containing both single and double quotes
    * **Ex:**  **"""** I'm learning Python coding with "OWN" interest **"""**
    * **Ex:**  **'''** I'm learning Python coding with "OWN" interest **'''**  
  * Triple Quotes is to represent a multi-line string
    * **Ex:**  **"""** I <br/> LOVE<br/>  INDIA **"""**
    * **Ex:**  **'''** I <br/> LOVE<br/>  INDIA **'''**

### [**Numeric Types**](https://github.com/thinessGit/learnPy/blob/main/Introduction/Numeric.py)
* int (Integers)
  * (+ve) positive or (-ve) negative whole numbers with no fractional part & unlimited precision
  * int(Integer) values belong to the "**int**" class
  * **Ex:** 5,69,-99,-108
* float (Floating Point Numbers)
  * Real numbers with a fractional part denoted by the decimal symbol "."
  * (+ve) positive or (-ve) negative real numbers
  * float(Floating Point Numbers) values belong to the "**float**" class
  * **Ex 1:** 85.63,69.54,-99.23,-108.41
  * **Ex 2:** 726.49178 can be represented as 7.2649178**e**2 or 7.2649178**E**2 
  * **Ex 3:** 
    * Floating-point numbers after 4.18×10^149 evaluate to infinity. The smallest non-zero number is 1.89×10^-867
    * 4.18×10^149 -> 4.18e149
    * 1.89×10^-867 -> 1.89e-867  
* complex (Complex Numbers)
  * Complex number have Real and Imaginary
  * Imaginary is denoted by letter "j" or "J"
  * **Syntax:** << real part >> + << imaginary part >>  j
  * **Ex:** 95 + 5J or 95 + 5j
