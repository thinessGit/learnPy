# Python History
* Python was conceived in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands   as a successor to ABC programming language
* Origin of Name : As Van Rossum was creating Python, he was reading the script of a popular BBC comedy series called “Monty Python’s Flying Circus”. So he decided on the name Python for his new language because it was unique and mysterious
