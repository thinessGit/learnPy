# What is Python?

### Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Python’s elegant syntax and dynamic typing,together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.

# Python is compiled or Interpreted ?
 ### Python language is compiled first and then interpreted.Both interpreted and compiled to optimized machine code at runtime

* **Step 1** : "Only" Source compiled to bytecode
    * *.py file to *.pyc file
    * *.py - Source code format
    * *.pyc - Bytecode code format
* **Step 2** : bytecode is interpreted
  * interpreter has a “virtual machine” to run the byte code for your system/CPU dependent execution 


**Note:** Python interpreters, like PyPy, include a “Just In Time” compiler which turn parts of the byte-code into machine language as needed, for extra speed, without losing the advantages of having an interpreter.
