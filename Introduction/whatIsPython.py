# Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to
# object-oriented programming. Python’s elegant syntax and dynamic typing,together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for
# scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.

# Python is compiled or Interpreted ?

# Python language is interpreted.
# But that is half correct the python program is first compiled and then interpreted.

# Step 1 : "Only" compiled to bytecode
# Step 2 : bytecode is interpreted
#
# Both interpreted and compiled to optimized machine code at runtime


# Python interpreters, like PyPy, include a “Just In Time”
# compiler which turn parts of the byte-code into machine language
# as needed, for extra speed, without losing the advantages of
# having an interpreter.
